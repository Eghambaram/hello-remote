Over time, different specifications of the Markdown syntax have evolved. For example, some common flavors of Markdown include:

* **Markdown** - the original created by Jon Gruber in 2004

* **CommonMark** - a standardization effort for the Markdown language

* **GitHub Flavored Markdown** - a derivative of CommonMark used on the GitHub site.
